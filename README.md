# InterSoccer Reports and Rosters Plugin

## Overview
The `reports-rosters` plugin generates real-time rosters and reports for InterSoccer Switzerlandâ€™s soccer camps, courses, and birthday events. It integrates with WooCommerce (WooComm) and the `player-management-plugin` to provide coaches and event organizers with detailed attendee lists, leveraging data from the 2024 Spring Courses (605 total participants across regions like Versoix, Geneva, Zurich, etc.). This plugin is part of the InterSoccer Website Redesign project on WordPress (WP).

## Features
- **Roster Generation**:
  - Creates rosters for events, listing assigned players, event details (e.g., "Days-of-week" for camps, prorated weeks for courses), and attributes like venue and city.
  - Supports custom roles (`coach`, `event organizer`) for secure access.
- **Reports**:
  - Generates summaries of event participation (e.g., 40 girls booked with GIRLSFREE24 code in 2024).
  - Provides regional breakdowns (e.g., 144 participants in Geneva, 128 in Zurich).
- **Real-Time Updates**:
  - Rosters update dynamically as parents book events and assign players.
- **Export Options**:
  - Allows exporting rosters as CSV or PDF for offline use by coaches.
